////i understood this best from mosh's video. sorting visualizer, a website that helps you visualise these algorithms helped out a lot too.

    for (int i=0; i<size; i++) { //the first loop is started to keep track of the number of passes required (n times for n elements)

        for (int j=0; j<size-1; j++) { //the second loop keeps track of individually passing over each element (n-1 times, because it checks the next element, we would have an out of bounds error if we continued till n)

                temp = unsorted[j+1];
